# Loine

**Routing, isolines and cost matrices directly in your PostgreSQL database.**

📖 Full documentation: [www.casageo.de/Loine](https://www.casageo.de/loine.html)

Loine delivers a ready-to-use road network for PostgreSQL/PostGIS together with a set of SQL functions for routing and reachability analysis. Install it in your own database and run routes, isolines, reachable grid cells and cost matrices with plain SQL – no external routing service, no API limits, no data leaving your infrastructure.

## Features

- **Routes** – fastest or shortest path between two points with travel time, distance and geometry
- **Isolines** – reachability polygons for one or several travel times or distances, from or to a location
- **Reachable segments** – every road segment within a budget, with its exact cost
- **Reachable grid cells** – 100 m grid cells within a budget, with their exact cost, for location and catchment analytics
- **Cost matrices** – travel time or distance between all pairs of an arbitrary set of points in a single call
- **Several modes of transport** – multiple car profiles, pedestrian and an unrestricted network mode
- **Realistic network** – one-way streets, turn restrictions and turn costs
- **Cross-border** – neighbouring countries are connected at their border crossings, so routes and isolines continue across borders

## How it works

Loine is delivered per country as a PostgreSQL dump. Each country contains:

| Table | Content |
|---|---|
| `edges` | Directed, routable road network with length, travel time and street category |
| `grids` | 100 m grid cells linked to the road network |
| `cluster`, `kacheln`, `partition` | 10 km clusters and 100 km tiles for fast preselection |
| `meta` | Data source, release and build information |

The network is based on HERE or OpenStreetMap data. Within Europe the grid follows the INSPIRE grid (EPSG:3035); outside Europe Loine uses continental equal-area projections with the same grid structure (Africa, North America incl. Central America).

The SQL functions use pgRouting and select only the part of the network a request needs, so queries stay fast even on country-wide or multi-country networks.

## Requirements

- PostgreSQL 18 with PostGIS and pgRouting
- PostgreSQL client tools `psql` and `pg_restore`, version 18 or later

## Quick start

Download the Loine software and the country data from the [Loine website](https://www.casageo.de/loine.html). The commands are the same on Windows, Linux and macOS.

Install the software (once, and again after each update):

```
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d mydb -f loine-<version>.sql
```

Load a country:

```
pg_restore -h localhost -U postgres -d mydb --no-owner -j 4 loine_<country>.dump
```

```sql
CALL pgr.loine_install_country('<country>');
```

After the last country, build indexes and statistics:

```sql
CALL pgr.loine_finalize();
```

The software can also be installed from this repository: run `install/loine_install.sql` and then `install/loine_functions.sql` instead of `loine-<version>.sql`. The country data is only available from the website.

Step-by-step instructions for Windows, Linux and macOS, for pgAdmin and DataGrip, and for updates are available on the [Loine website](https://www.casageo.de/loine.html).

## Usage

All coordinates are WGS84 longitude/latitude.

```sql
-- Route by travel time
SELECT * FROM pgr.cgo_path(17.107, 48.148, 21.258, 48.716, 'car', 'time');

-- 15-minute isoline from a location
SELECT pgr.cgo_isoline(17.107, 48.148, 15, 'car', 'time', 'from');

-- 5, 10 and 15-minute isolines in one call
SELECT * FROM pgr.cgo_multiisolines(17.107, 48.148, '5,10,15', 'car', 'time', 'from');

-- 100 m grid cells reachable within 10 minutes
SELECT * FROM pgr.cgo_grids(17.107, 48.148, 10, 'car', 'time', 'from');

-- Travel time matrix between all points of a table (columns node_id, x, y)
SELECT * FROM pgr.cgo_costmatrix('my_schema.my_locations', 'card', 'time');
```

### Functions

| Function | Returns |
|---|---|
| `pgr.cgo_path(start_lon, start_lat, end_lon, end_lat, mode, calc)` | Route time, distance, traffic cost and geometry |
| `pgr.cgo_isoline(lon, lat, value, mode, calc, direction)` | Isoline polygon |
| `pgr.cgo_multiisolines(lon, lat, 'v1,v2,…', mode, calc, direction)` | One isoline per value |
| `pgr.cgo_isoline_static(lon, lat, value, mode, calc, direction)` | Isoline polygon, static catchment variant |
| `pgr.cgo_segments(lon, lat, value, mode, calc, direction)` | Reachable road segments with cost |
| `pgr.cgo_grids(lon, lat, value, mode, calc, direction)` | Reachable 100 m grid cells with cost |
| `pgr.cgo_costmatrix(input_table, mode, calc)` | Cost between all point pairs (N×N) |
| `pgr.cgo_costmatrix_snap_report(input_table, mode)` | Distance between input points and their position on the network |

### Parameters

| Parameter | Values |
|---|---|
| `mode` | `car`, `card`, `caro`, `care`, `pedestrian`, `no_mode` |
| `calc` | `time` (minutes), `distance` (metres), `traffic` (minutes, routes and isolines) |
| `direction` | `from` (outbound from the location), `to` (inbound to the location) |

## Typical applications

- Catchment areas and drive-time zones for retail, healthcare and public services
- Location planning and site comparison
- Population and potential analysis on 100 m grid cells
- Accessibility studies and coverage analysis
- Distance and travel time matrices for logistics and planning
